# Technical Strategy

Use of Open Source is ubiquitous within all sizes of organizations.
As with any component that an organization depends
on, the organization needs to manage risk that arises from the use
of that dependency.

The goal of the OpenJS Foundations is to:
* Foster a strong and vibrant JavaScript ecosystem so that it remains a good
  technology choice now and into the future.
* Support Open Source JavaScript projects that want to grow beyond "me" to "we" and
  plan for a succession of maintainers over their lifespan. 
* Help organizations manage their risk by supporting the projects they depend on.

Our strategy is to meet those goals by:
* Provide neutral space and resources where people can come together
  to collaborate on what is important to the success and growth of the
  JavaScript ecosystem.
* Helping projects build infrastructure and process so that they outlast the 
  contributions of any one individual or company.
* Help projects focus on their high impact work versus
  administrative/operational tasks.
* Help organizations understand the projects they depend on, provide channels 
  for them to easily support those projects and to realize value from those
  contributions.
* Document best practices that reduce risk for contributors and consumers
  and help projects implement them efficiently.

We do this through:

* [Support for maintainers]()
* [Support for projects]()
* [Support for individuals and organizations using JavaScript](./support_for_orgs_and_individuals.md)
* [Support for Ecosystem]()
