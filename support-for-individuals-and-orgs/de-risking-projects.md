# De-risking projects

Succesful JavaScript deployments require the use of components within
the ecosystem as well as developing your own code. For the components
used from the ecosystem, you can manage your risk by chosing projects which
have these attributes:

* Good cve management
* Good security practices
* Collaborative and open to contributions
* Strong and healthy collaborator base 
    * Open and level playing field
    * Good Governance
        * Impact Projects have governance requirement of no more than 30% from same company
        * All projects must have CoC & enforcement process
* Good Licences
* Healthy infrastructure
* Level of adoption
* Transparent and careful change management
   * For example, respect for SemVer
* Manage secrets/infrastructure etc. so that any one individual moving on 
* Minimize their depdence on key individuals (have succession plans in placee)

* Strong trademark and IPR Policy enforcement enforcement
* Ensuring projects follow Security Vulnerability Disclosure paths

We help projects take on these attribute by:

For most deployments you will need application components and development tools,  from a number of different categories. The OpenJS foundation's vision is to expand our list of member projects so that there is coverage across the most important categories. These categories include:

* Application Components
 * Runtime platforms
 * Backend Web Frameworks
 * Frontend Web Frameworks
 * Utilities
 * Internationalization tools
 * Parsing tools
 * Native Code Integration
 * Streaming
 * Http requests
 * Logging
 * Monitoring/Metrics Reporting
 * Databases
 * Message Queuing 
 * Template Engines
 * Microservice Components
 * Frontend Components

* Development tools
  * Code Quality
    * Testing
    * Code Consistency
    * Accessibilty
  * Build Tools 
  * Version Management

The following shows the OpenJS member projects and how they map to these
categories:

Our strategy is to focus recruitment efforts on categories that don't have enough coverage while
remaining to open to any good project that approaches us.
